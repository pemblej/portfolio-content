        <p>Welcome to my page about my favorite industrial designs. As an artist and designer, I think of the products I use and surround myself with as functional art, and so I am very passionate about delightfully designed products. My absolute favorites are objects that I appreciate for their design as much as I do their capabilities.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>This site showcases 3 products I enjoy most in my daily life: the 24‚Äù iMac designed by Apple, the Soundsticks 4 designed by Harman/Kardon, and the Xbox Series S designed by Microsoft. Each is unique in its aesthetic, but all share some common design elements as well.</p>
