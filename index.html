  <p class="p1">Welcome to my page about my favorite industrial designs. As an artist and designer, I think of the products I use and surround myself with as functional art, and so I am very passionate about delightfully designed products. My absolute favorites are objects that I appreciate for their design as much as I do their capabilities.</p>

  <p class="p1">This site showcases 3 products I enjoy most in my daily life: the 24” iMac designed by Apple, the Soundsticks 4 designed by Harman/Kardon, and the Xbox Series S designed by Microsoft. Each is unique in its aesthetic, but all share some common design elements as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
