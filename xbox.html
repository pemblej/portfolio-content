        <p>“Xbox Series S were designed to fit in anyone’s home; they are architectural in nature, have personality and a visual appearance that the team believes will stand up over time. The consoles become the physical representation of a quality experience that will pair with any style and game type. Most importantly, they can stand out or disappear into the environment they’re placed in based on our fans’ preferences.”</p>
        <p>What makes the Xbox Series S design special is in its simple, true to form approach. Leveraging the Xbox name, it takes on a box shape better than any other Xbox to date. It is compact and has no embellishments; everything serves a purpose. This extends into one of its defining features as well—the lack of a disc drive. While this may seem like a detractor to some, I prefer it because it is not necessary to playing video games, and makes the design cleaner.</p>
